# ArcGIS-Challenge
For this timed coding challenge I used the ArcGIS API to build a map scene in React that allows the user to filter an array of objects and display the location and attributes of the filtered results.

## How to Use

## Programming
* React
* ArcGIS API
* CSS

## Notes
This project currently isn't responsive on small devices such as phones. However, it does scale for tablets and other mid-size devices.
