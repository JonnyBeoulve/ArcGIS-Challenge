# ArcGIS-Challenge
For this coding challenge I'm using the ArcGIS API to build an interface in React that allows the user to filter a list of people and display their location on a 3D map. Map markers and attribute display functionality is incorporated into the user interface.

## How to Use
A hosted demo will be available soon.

## Notes
This coding challenge has a time limit.
