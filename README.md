# ArcGIS-Challenge
For this coding challenge I've used the ArcGIS API to build an interface in React that allows the user to filter a list of people and display their location on a 3D map. Map markers and attribute display functionality is incorporated into the user interface.

## Notes
This project currently isn't responsive on small devices such as phones. However, it does scale for tablets and other mid-size devices.
